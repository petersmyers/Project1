**Project Description/Outline:**  
- We will be analyzing the affects of Medical Marijuana on diseases that were treated by medical marijuana when it became legalized. We will be looking for relationship between the mortality rate before mdical maraijuana was initalized and after in those states for certain disease. 
    
**Research Questions to Answer:**
    1. Is the mortality rate lower for those with  Multiple Scerosis after the implementation of medical cannabis
    2. Is the mortality rate lower for those with Cancer after the implementation of medical cannabis
    3. Is the mortality rate lower for those with HIV/AIDS after the implementation of medical cannabis
    4. Is there a lower rate of seizures for people who have Epilepsy after the usage of medical cannabis
    5. is the rate of Insomnia lower after the inplementation of medical cannabis

**Datasets to be Used:**

- (still looking for data, any and all help is greatly appreciated)
    
**Rough Breakdown of Tasks:**
- Adam- Visualizations
- Peter- Analysis
- Preeya- data cleaning

**Problems:**
- Problems we maybe facing is actually getting the data on medical marijuana so in order to solve this we will have to be more creative in our way of searching for the data and what kinda of data sets we can look at. 
- Different states differ in how long medical marijuana was legalized therefore we will not have complete and equal data for each state.
