**Title:** "The Ethnicity of Heart Disease"

**Team Members:** Preeya Dahya, Peter Myers, Adam Feldstein

**Project Description/Outline:**  
Heart disease is a massive killer in the US. We know there are many factors that contribute to the development of heart disease, from socioeconomic factors to genetics. Our group wants to better understand the prevelence of heart disease in different ethnicities (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian) within the US. We will also probe socioeconomic factors by analyzing the availability of hopitals as well as fast food restaurants (by county). Using these data, we'll be able to look at simple correlations between heart disease, ethnicity, hospital availability, and fast food availability. 
    
**Research Questions to Answer:**
    1. Across the United States, what is the prevelence of heart disease in different ethnicities? 
    2. Is the rate of heart disease proportional to overall population for different ehtnicities (i.e., 50% of heart disease cases are in ethnically White individuals, and 50% of the US population is ethnically White)?
    3. Is there a relationship between heart disease rates and number of available hospitals, regardless of ethnicity?
    4. Is there a relationship between heart disease rates and number of available fast food restaurants, regardless of ethnicity?
    5. Can heart disease be predicted by ethnicity, hospital availability, and fast food restaurant availability?


**Datasets to be Used:**
- Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle
- Google places for hospital and fast food availability by county
- Census data for population by ethnicity
    
**Breakdown of Tasks:**
- Adam - Retrieve hospital data, visualizations
- Preeya- Clean heart disease data set, retrieve fast food data, visualizations
- Peter- Retrieve census data, visualization, statistics


**Problems:**
- Making sure we have enough data after combining all datasets together
- Destroying our credit cards by accidentally using the Google API 20 too many times 
- Time. Time. Time.
